# Scene Pitch

We decided to set our scene in a beautiful forest early in the morning (early enough that the stars still show). Mohammad is really craving a lot of marshmallows, but he needs them to be in a perfect golden brown state. He is sitting on a log in front of a fire surrounded by mountains, trees and stars. There are 3 objects that are autonomously animated: the fire, the marshmallow (burning) and the stars moving. We have also given the user 2 things to do: they can explore the scene by moving/panning the camera and they can start burning a new marshmallow by double clicking on the screen. We recommend that the user gives Mohammad a new marshmallow once he notices (when an exclamation mark appears) that the marshmallow is starting to burn. 

## Features

Double (left) click will reset the marshmallow’s color to white

Marshmallow lerps to golden brown then lerps to black after it reaches golden brown

Exclamation mark appears when marshmallow starts to burn (to black) 

Fire animates to “burn” the marshmallow. Fire occasionally breaches the laws of physics and becomes a cube... as designed..

Trees and stars placed randomly each initialization. 

Camera Controls: Click and drag with left click to orbit. Click and drag with right click to pan. Scroll with scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
