# Credits

Khalid - I worked on the person and star files. The person was designed to sit down and hold a marshmallow that burns over time. I worked on making the marshmallow lerp from white to golden brown and then from golden brown to black. Additionally, I coded an exclamation mark to appear when the marshmallow starts to lerp to black; this indicates that the marshmallow is burning. Also, I worked on the stars and their population/movement; they move around the origin at some radius away at the same speed.
Assets: person.js (including head.js, arm.js, body.js, leg.js, marshmellow.js, exclamation.js) and star.js 

Kevin - I worked on the Tree asset and the functionality of randomly populating the trees to create the forests.
Assets: Tree.js

Megan - I worked on the tent, mountain, mountain range, stump, and lake objects. The tent, mountain, and mountain range utilizes the grouping of different geometries to create the final object. All of my assets have integrated textures as well. In addition, I created the “skybox” in our main demo-universe.js file that makes the scene appear as though it has a 360° view of the sky and staged all of our objects to make the composition feel more complete. 
Assets: tent.js, mountain.js & mountain_range.js, lake.js, stump.js

Saad - I worked on the fire, the log and stump, the floor plane, and the camera, The fire uses a group of cube objects, all of which are rotated in different directions to simulate a fire blazing. The stump consists of a cylinder, a cone, and a torus knot to create a tree stump with some exposed roots. The logs are made with a composite of a cylinder and some cubes. Also, I made the new camera panning and zooming using the OrbitControls feature in three.js.
Assets: fire.js, log.js, plane.js, stump_saad.js. Animations & Interactivity: animation of fire.js, orbit, pan, and zoom features of camera.
